## Research Projects  

### **Predicting Alzheimer’s Using Machine Learning**  
📍 *Pioneer Centre for AI – University of Copenhagen*  
🗓️ *July 2024 – August 2024*  
I developed and optimized a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict Alzheimer's Disease based on MRI biomarkers. To enhance model performance, I implemented 10-fold cross-validation and conducted a grid search to fine-tune hyperparameters. Additionally, I extracted features from MRI scans using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch, leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained weights. This approach resulted in a 0.84 validation AUC score, effectively distinguishing between MRI scans of individuals with and without Alzheimer’s Disease.

### **Neural Network Benchmarking for Transcription & Translation**  
📍 *University of California, Los Angeles*  
🗓️ *August 2023 – June 2024*  
I trained and benchmarked OpenAI’s Whisper model to transcribe and translate Russian media clips, evaluating its effectiveness across different model sizes. To assess performance, I compared the small, medium, and large Whisper models using word error rate and BLEU score. Additionally, I designed a processing pipeline on a UCLA Linux GPU system to transcribe and translate over 1,000 hours of Russian audio, contributing to research on media bias.
